Moduli:

It is common in physics to study field theories defined on the spacetime $\RR^n$.
As the underlying spacetime $\RR^n$ is a group under addition (i.e., it is the translation group),
it is natural to ask for field theories with an action by translations.
That is, since the fields are sections of a fiber bundle over $RR^n$,
one can ask for an equivariant fiber bundle and ask for the equations of motion (or action functional) to be equivariant under translations.
In practice, physicists often work with field theories whose equations of motion are differential equations with constant coefficients.
(All the examples we've discussed in this survey satisfy this condition.)


Now such a field theory $\cT$ on $\RR^n$ has a space of solutions $\Sol_\cT(\RR^n)$ to its equations of motion.
A {\em classical vacuum} for the theory is a solution that this translation-invariant,
i.e., a constant solution.
As the solutions $\Sol(\RR^n)$ is a derived stack (at least if you adhere to the perspective we've advocated here), there is a derived stack of classical vacua
\[
\cM_{\rm vac}(\cT) = \Sol_\cT(\RR^n)^{\RR^n}
\]
given by the substack of constant solutions.
We call it the {\em moduli stack of classical vacua} for the theory~$\cT$.

Many stacks of interest to geometers and representation theorists appear naturally from holomorphic field theories.
For example, the holomorphic $\sigma$-model from $\CC^d$ into a target complex manifold $X$ has
\[
\cM_{\rm vac} \cong T^*[1-d]X.
\]
For example, pure $\cN =1$ holomorphic Yang-Mills theory for group $G$ has \owen{true?}
\[
\cM_{\rm vac} \cong \fg/G,
\]
the adjoint quotient stack of the group.
For supersymmetric gauge theories, the holomorphic twist has the form
\[
\cM_{\rm vac} \cong V/G
\]
where $V$ is a (graded) $G$-representation and $V/G$ denotes the quotient stack.
For most supersymmetric field theories, the holomorphic twist has a moduli stack of classical vacua of the form
\[
\cM_{\rm vac} \cong X/G
\]
where $X$ is a derived stack with a $G$-action and $X/G$ denotes the quotient stack.

In studying questions about the classical vacua of supersymmetric field theories, physicists have not typically worked with the {\em stack}.
Instead, they have worked with a GIT quotient.
For instance, in the setting of a gauge theory with stack $V/G$ of classical vacua, it means they work with
\[
V//G = \Spec(\cO(V)^G),
\]
the scheme whose ring of functions are the $G$-invariant functions on the representation~$V$.
This affine scheme is known as the {\em affinization} of the stack $V/G$, as it is the best affine approximation to the stack (i.e., the left adjoint to the inclusion of affine schemes among stacks).
We will call it the moduli {\em space} of classical vacua and denote it by~$M_{rm vac}(\cT)$.

It is familiar to geometers, of course, that this affinization forgets interesting information about the stack because an invariant function must be constant on the closure of an orbit.
In other words, the canonical map
\[
V/G \to V//G
\]
often collapses orbits together.
A familiar example, pertinent to $\cN =1$ super Yang-Mills theory, is the adjoint quotient $\gl_N/ GL_N$, whose affinization is
\[
\gl_N//GL_N \cong \CC^N/S_N
\]
by the Chevalley restriction theorem.
The canonical map here records the characteristic polynomial of a matrix and hence only knows its generalized eigenvalues and not its Jordan decomposition.
In other words, the canonical map collapses together Jordan blocks with the same diagonal entries.
For this reason, it loses details about the classical vacua remembered by the stack quotient.

\begin{remark}
The physicists' focus on the moduli space is not unreasonable:
one must make measurements --- i.e., evaluate functions --- to identify the state of a physical system.
The moduli space captures what can be seen by measurements (notably here, the ``vacuum expectation values'' of different vacua).
On the other hand, the moduli stack encodes the full data of the theory near each vacuum.
For instance, it remembers ``enhanced symmetries'' (such as the residual gauge fields) at each vacuum.
\end{remark}

For the holomorphic QCD theory \owen{write data} the moduli stack of classical vacua is \owen{write it}
The moduli space is a well-known variety
\[
M_{rm vac}(\cT) \cong \Gr(N_f, N_c)
\]
by using classical invariant theory. \owen{show?}
A similar computation on the putative dual shows the following.

\begin{prop}
Seiberg dual theories have isomorphic moduli spaces.
\end{prop}

This relationship, which holds already for the supersymmetric theory before twisting, was one of the original pieces of evidence offered by Seiberg for his duality.

\owen{Sketch proof}: This is the first and second fundamental theorem of classical invariant theory!

\begin{remark}
In the physics literature this isomorphism is given by explicitly matching gauge-invariant functions, which are often called mesons or baryons, as they can be identified with the data that identifies such particles.
These meson and baryons are precisely the usual generators of the ring of invariant functions, so an isomorphism of generators determines the desired isomorphism of rings. 
One must check that the relations are satisfied;
here it explains the superpotential on the magnetic side.
\end{remark}

We want to point out, however, that {\em the moduli stacks are not isomorphic}.
A quick check is to note that there are orbits with different stabilizer groups.
Consider, for instance, the origin in each vector space.
On the electric side its stabilizer is $SL(N_c)$ and on the magnetic side it is $SL(N_f - N_c)$.
Hence Seiberg duality cannot hold at the stack level for the classical theories.

On the other hand, on an open locus, the moduli stacks are equivalent. 
At a point $x$ on the semi-stable locus of $V//G$ \owen{fix description}, 
the perturbative classical theory around the vacuum $x$ is equivalent to a holomorphic $\sigma$-model into the tangent space $T_x (V//G)$
\owen{Elaborate}, 
and there is an explicit identification of the tangent space to the corresponding point in the moduli space of the dual theory.
Thanks to this identification, we can see that the isomorphism on the semi-stable points should survive to quantization.

\begin{question}
At the quantum level, what happens on the unstable locus?
