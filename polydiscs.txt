Associative algebras arise in quantum mechanics, we have argued, because the spacetime of a mechanical system is a line (``time'').
If we organize the observables (or operators) by when they happen in time,
it corresponds to writing them left-to-right as products in an algebra.
A natural question to ask then is what kind of higher algebraic structure captures how observables behave for theories in higher dimensions?
The shortest answer is ``factorization algebras,'' and we will describe and explore this notion in Section~\ref{sec fact alg},
but there are nice answers for two special classes of theories that we will develop now:
\begin{itemize}
\item For a topological field theory on $\RR^d$ (which we'll define in a moment),
the observables form an algebra over the {\em little $d$-disks operad}~$E_d$. 
Equivalently, one says the observables are an $E_d$-algebra. 
This notion was introduced by algebraic topologists in the 1960s, 
so there is a rich body of work to draw upon.
\item For a holomorphic field theory on $\CC^d$,
the observables form an algebra over the $d$-polydiscs operad~$\PD_d$.
This notion was introduced only recently in~\cite{CG1}.
\end{itemize}
We will make the assertions above precise (in part by adding some natural but necessary hypotheses on a theory)
and develop them in parallel.
As a particularly illuminating example, we will explore the $d=1$ case rather closely and explain in what sense a vertex algebra is a kind of ``holomorphic associative algebra.''
We will also discuss the polydiscs algebras for which the higher Kac-Moody algebras are a Lie-algebraic shadow.

Before jumping into the main story, we mention a motivation for talking about $E_d$- and $\PD_d$-algebras in parallel.
By dealing with both, we are suggesting, of course, that there is a natural analogy and hence a useful transfer of intuition between the settings of topological and holomorphic field theories.
But there is a stronger, technical relationship that we'll develop via a version of dimensional reduction.
From each holomorphic field theory in complex dimension $d$, 
we'll extract an $E_d$-algebra.
This construction generalizes the relationship between the Kac-Moody vertex algebra of a Lie algebra $\fg$ at level $k$ and the central extension of the loop algebra~$L\fg$.
We expect this correspondence to bear rich fruit.

\subsection{Generalizing associative algebras for topological field theories}

We want to describe the algebraic structures that appear in $d$-dimensional topological field theories,
as a model for holomorphic field theories.
It will be helpful to use the language of operads, which are an efficient and powerful tool for defining and studying algebraic structures,
so we will gloss the key ideas of operads briefly and then turn to describing the operads relevant to TFTs.
A more extensive discussion can be found in \cite{CG1}, with \cite{ES} studying the topological setting in an elegant way.

An associative algebra is, by definition, a vector space $A$ with a linear map $\mu: A\otimes A \to A$ satisfying that the linear map $\mu \circ (\id \otimes \mu): A^{\otimes 3} \to A$ equals the linear map $\mu \circ (\mu \otimes \id)$.
(Let's ignore the other data and conditions for the moment.)
Nearly all flavors of algebras --- Lie, Poisson, and so on --- have a similar definition:
one has a collection of multilinear maps that satisfy some relations.
An operad is a way of specifying such data, so there is an associative operad $Ass$,
a Lie operad $Lie$, and so on.

Before sketching the definition, we give a concrete example.
Let $V$ be a vector space.
Then every $n$-fold multilinear operator on $V$ is an element of $\Hom(V^{\otimes n}, V)$;
that vector space parametrizes all possible $n$-ary operations on $V$.
One can also compose such operations to produce new ones.
For instance, given $\mu : V^{\otimes m} \to V$ and $\nu: V^{\otimes m} \to V$, we can put the output of $\mu$ into the $i$th input of $\nu$ to produce a new operation
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\nu \circ_i \mu: & V^{\otimes m+n-1} & \to & V\\
& v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_{m+n-1} & \mapsto & \nu(v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mu(v_i
\]
\owen{finish the formula! make it agree with conventional formulas}
where $i$ can run over any index between 1 and $n$.
We call this collection of data the {\em endomorphism operad of $V$}, denote $\End_V$.
It consists of 
\begin{itemize}
\item a list of vector spaces labelling $n$-ary operations, with 
\[
\End_V(n)= \Hom(V^{\otimes n}, V),
\]
with $n \in \NN$, and
\item a list of linear maps
\[
\circ_i : \End_V(n) \otimes \End_V(m) \to \End_V(n+m-1)
\]
for every pair $n$ and $m$ and where $1 \leq i \leq n$.
\end{itemize}
There are certain natural relations when one does multiple compositions, like $\mu \circ_i (\nu \circ_j \pi)$, arising from how multilinear maps compose.

Just as the model case of an associative algebra is $\End(V) = \Hom(V,V)$ (the ring of square matrices),
the endomorphism operad is the model case of operads.
A linear operad $P$ consists of a list of vectors $\left(P(n) \right)_{n \in \NN}$, where each $P(n)$ is a vector space describing $n$-ary operations, and a list of linear maps $\(\circ_i)$.
We will not describe the relations.

\begin{remark}
The reader might ask why the adjective {\em linear} was appended before {\em operad}.
The reason is that we discussed algebraic operations on vector spaces,
but one can, of course, discuss analogs in other settings.
For instance, a monoid is a set $M$ with a multiplication map satisfying an associativity constraint.
One can talk about operads in sets (``an operad in sets $P$ has a set $P(n)$ of $n$-ary operations for every $n \in \NN$ \dots'') or in topological spaces or in dg vector spaces.
In fact, the theory works in any symmetric monoidal category. 
\end{remark}

Let us now raise another useful analogy.
To define a module for an associative algebra $A$, one specifies an algebra map $\rho: A \to \End(V)$.
This map encodes how $A$ acts on $V$.
Similarly, to give an algebra for an operad $P$, one specifies an operad map $\rho: P \to \End_V$.
This map picks out specific multilinear operations on $V$ that will satisfy the relations we want.
For instance, if $P$ is the Poisson operad, then $P(2) \cong \CC^2$ and this vector space is spanned by an element $\cdot$, the commutative product, and $\{\}$, the Poisson bracket.
The map $f(2): P(2) \to \End_V(2)$ thus tells us both the commutative and Poisson bracket put upon~$V$.
By studying the operad $P$ itself, one can thus obtain universal results that hold for all $P$-algebras.
